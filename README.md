# SLT Repo Template

A template to be used for Storm Library for Terraform repositories.

#### Storm Library for Terraform

This repository is a member of the SLT | Storm Library for Terraform,
a collection of Terraform modules for Amazon Web Services. The focus
of these modules, maintained in separate GitHub™ repositories, is on
building examples, demos and showcases on AWS. The audience of the
library is learners and presenters alike - people that want to know
or show how a certain service, pattern or solution looks like, or "feels".
